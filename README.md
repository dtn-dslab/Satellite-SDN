# Satellite-SDN
A SDN-style satellite network emulation system running on K8s cluster.

## Description
![](./asset/arch.jpg)

Satellite-SDN provides users with a CLI interface to customize emulation environment (the typical input is a TLE file). Satellite-SDN builds a emulation env according to satellite orbit described by TLE file and updates env with timeout specified by the user.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/sdn-kubebuilder:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/sdn-kubebuilder:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Every new feature should have its own branch.

Use PR to merge your branch into main branch.

And commit comment should obey [git commit norm](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/182553920)


### How it works

Satellite-SDN has 3 components:
1. SDN Server: `/sdn`
2. Route CRD Controller: `/controllers`
3. CLI Interface: `/cmd`


**SDN Server**

SDN server provides function call interfaces for CLI interfaces.

Two main APIs:
```
func RunSatelliteSDN(startParams) error;
func DelSatelliteSDN(endParams) error;
```

Http interface and grpc interface are being built now.

Https interface:
```
func CreateSDNHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request);
func UpdateSDNHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request);
func DelSDNHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request);
```

**Route CRD Controller**

This component aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

**CLI Interface**

**Build**: `make sdn`

**Run**: `./bin/sdnctl init [FLAGS]`

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
