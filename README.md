# Satellite-SDN
A SDN-style satellite network emulation system running on K8s cluster.

## Description

<!-- ![](./asset/arch.png) -->

Satellite-SDN provides users with a CLI interface `sdnctl pos` to customize emulation environment (the typical input is a TLE file). Satellite-SDN builds a emulation env according to informations provided by User Module and updates env with timeout specified by the user.

## How it works

Satellite-SDN has 4 components:
1. SDN Server: `/sdn`
2. User Module: `/pos`
3. Route CRD Controller: `/controllers`
4. CLI Interface: `/cmd`

A **CNI plugin** like Cilium, Flannel is needed. Also, you should install [**kubedtn**](https://github.com/dtn-dslab/kube-dtn) to enable `Topology` Custom Resource, which is of great importance for our system.

And you should use our specified image `electronicwaste/podserver:<tag>` for route deployment.

### SDN Server

SDN server processes params from User Module and deploy `Pod`,`Topology`, `Route` to K8s cluster.

### User Module

Currently, User Module can only provide location information. You can specify TLE file, from which User Module will generate location informations, passing them to SDN Server.

**Build**: `make sdn`

**Run**: `./bin/sdnctl pos [FLAGS]`

### Route CRD Controller

This component aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### CLI Interface

**Build**: `make sdn`

**Run**: `./bin/sdnctl init [FLAGS]`

## Deploy Route Controller
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/sdn-kubebuilder:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/sdn-kubebuilder:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
